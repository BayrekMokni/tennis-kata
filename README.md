# Tennis Rules:
## Win a game
In a standard game (as opposed to a tie-break), each point increases the value of the player to the next value of the following sequence : 0, 15, 30, 40.

If a player has 40 and scores, then he wins the game.

## Deuce state
If both players have 40, then it's deuce. The next player to value a point will have the advantage (yes, it is not the winning point !). If the opponent then scores, the advantage is lost and they are back to deuce (40-40).

To win in deuce, a player must :

    1. gain the advantage

    2. value while he has the advantage
